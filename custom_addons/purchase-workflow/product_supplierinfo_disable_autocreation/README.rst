Usage

If you want to control the automatic creation of supplier price lists:

1. Go to Purchase, then to Configuration, and open the purchasing
   settings.
2. In the Orders section, find the "Enable Automatic Supplier Price
   Lists" option.
3. Check this box to enable the automatic creation of supplier price
   lists when validating purchase orders, or uncheck it to prevent these
   lines from being generated automatically.
4. The setting is applied per company, allowing for different
   configurations in a multi-company environment.
