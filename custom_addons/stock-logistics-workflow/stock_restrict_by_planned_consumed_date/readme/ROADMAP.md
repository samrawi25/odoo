- Today we restrict the reservation based on the lot expiration date,
  but in some circumstances we probably want something configurable to
  base the restriction on use_date (best before).
- Find a nice way to be compliant with both modules product_expiry and
  product_expiry_simple. This would require to launch unittest twice
  with both modules.
